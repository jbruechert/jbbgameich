You found the profile of a KDE Developer, currently working on 
* [🗨️ Kaidan](https://invent.kde.org/network/kaidan)
* [📱 Plasma Mobile](https://invent.kde.org/plasma-mobile/)
* [📲 Debian PM](https://gitlab.com/debian-pm/)

I'm helping out at many other projects, for example
* [📦 flathub](https://github.com/flathub)
* [🏫 OpenBoard](https://github.com/openboard-org/openboard)

In the past (and sometimes still today) I worked on some of the following topics:
* 👾 Minetest Mods & Texture packs
* Halium

Programming languages I expecially like:
 * C++ (more with every new version of the standard)
 * Rust
 * Haskell
 * QML (in the hope it will soon be a compiled language)
